    <p>Without revealing much, Mooen Ali has said that England have plans to stop Virat Kohli. It’s a nothing quote really, just that they will stifle the runs and hope the pressure brings about the wicket. But one wonders, whether deep inside, he does harbour hopes of taking down Kohli on his own. Because he has done it in the past.
        Moeen has clean-bowled Kohli in the past, even in Tests, with his big-turning loopy off-breaks. Kohli has tried the cover drive on his stretched front-foot and was bowled once in a Test in Chennai.
